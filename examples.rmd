# Parallel computing in R. A brief introduction and a few examples.



## What is parallel computing?
Parallel computation is the simultaneous executions of different pieces of a
(normally large) computation across multiple processors or cores. The interest of
this technique is that you can execute a process that takes *x* seconds on a
single processor in *x/n* seconds using *n* processors (this is the ideal case,
that is rarely possible to achieve).

We can use this in a supercomputer (like the [UCA's
cluster](https://supercomputacion.uca.es/)), but also in almost any device with multiple processors or cores. And happily nowadays most of our PCs and laptops have multicore processors.

How serial computing sometimes looks like in our
computers, as it happens most of the time in R (awesome GIF from my WOT gaming years):

Instead, we want our cores to be a team!:

## How to do parallel computing in R

Ok, so how does this work? We need to create a structure that sets a *director node* that is going to distribute data and functions between the *workers*, that will execute the interactions. This structure will allocate and manage the resorces, like number of cores, RAM memory and so. I will show you two different systems: **FORK** and
**PSOCK**.

## Examples

### Making apply functions parallel

We can make the functions from the *apply* family parallel , [example by Jens Moll-Elsborg](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-parallel-programming-in-r-d5f801d43745). Create the data:

```{create data}
# Create a vector with 1 billion elements
data <- 1:1e9

# Make a list of 4 of these vectors
data_list <- list("1" = data,
                  "2" = data,
                  "3" = data,
                  "4" = data
)
```
Calculate the mean 

```{serial examples}
# Calculate the mean of every vector
time_benchmark <- system.time(
    lapply(data_list, mean)
)
time_benchmark # Total of 12.83s in my machine
```
